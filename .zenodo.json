  "description": "This repository contains the software implementation for our paper A Novel Approach to Higgs Coupling Measurements (Cranmer, Kreiss, Lopez-Val, Plehn), arXiv:1401.0080 [hep-ph]. It contains tools to apply the discussed methods to new models and contains a Makefile to recreate the plots in the paper. A demo for the recoupling stage where the effective likelihood and template parametrization are readily provided is at decoupledDemo.",
